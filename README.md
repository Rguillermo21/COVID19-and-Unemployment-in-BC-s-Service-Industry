Using time-series data on BC's service industry we were able to analyze key employment statistics and demographics. The variables included gender, sector, education, region, and date. Afterwards, we analyzed the correlations in increased unemployment with government policy responses toward the pandemic.

Secondly we use CERB data to examine if the increases in unemployment in the BC service industry contributes to increased participation in CERB. This is particularly important to observe because we should see a correlated increase at roughly similar times. Otherwise, CERB may not be performing it's role adequately in aiding vulnerable groups during lockdown, where their occupations require them to be on-site and the business being heavily reliant on the flow of people. 

Next we conducted sentiment analysis using latent dirichlet allocation on news articles relating to COVID-19 and the service industry to capture media sentiments on covid-19 and the Canadian government's response.

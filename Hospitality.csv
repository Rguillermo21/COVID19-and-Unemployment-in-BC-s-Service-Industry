1,"Opinion: B.C. tourism is on life support. We must act now to save this vital industry from disaster. Like Vancouver and Victoria, Richmond has seen tourism fall dramatically since the COVID-19 pandemic began Without government support, the collapse of the visitor economy in our cities will have a devastating impact on the rest of the province, argue the CEOs of Destination Greater Victoria, Tourism Vancouver and Tourism Richmond As the summer draws to a close and the provincial government nears a decision on how to allocate its $1.5-billion recovery package, it would be easy for some people to make the false assumption that a strong August for some tourism operators means the B.C. tourism sector is on the road to recovery. Nothing could be further from the truth. Unlike the forestry, mining, technology and manufacturing sectors, which have remained open for global trade, tourism is the only industry that has been virtually shut down by government, thanks to the closure of our borders to international travel. Although that was the right thing to do to keep us safe, it has crippled thousands of tourism businesses and jobs reliant upon international visitors. Our cities have been particularly hard-hit. When our airports and borders closed to global travel, our cities lost their most lucrative markets. Travellers from the U.S. spend twice as much as domestic travellers and non-U.S. international travellers three times as much. As our peak season winds down, it’s now clear that revenue from local travellers and staycations will never come close to making up for the millions of international travellers we’ve lost. Cities play a distinct role the visitor economy. They are strategic gateways to communities across the province. In a highly competitive world, they are the front door attracting visitors, critical investment and human capital. Transportation hubs and convention destinations, they are centres of major tourism infrastructure. Tourism businesses in our cities are in serious trouble, and this is the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the province. One of the most important measures of the tourism sector’s health is hotel occupancy rates in our larger cities. Before COVID-19, yearly hotel occupancy in Greater Victoria and the Lower Mainland was in the range of 75 to 80 percent. Year-to-date, Greater Victoria hotel occupancy is 34 percent. In Vancouver, it sits at 26 percent for the summer. And in Richmond (which had the highest hotel occupancy in Canada over the past few years), it’s even lower. Through July in our provincial capital, a city where two in five working people are employed directly or indirectly in the visitor economy, tourism revenue is down a staggering 68 percent from 2019. That shortfall has serious implications. The projected economic losses for tourism in Metro Vancouver add up to $9.8 billion in visitor spending, $5.8 billion in gross domestic product, $2.6 billion in taxes to government and 72,000 full-time-equivalent jobs. And if tourism businesses fail, there will be no jobs for these people to return to next spring. In B.C., cities anchor the province’s visitor economy, which is an industry of industries—hotels, attractions, airlines and airports, retail, restaurants, festivals, conferences and events. All of these businesses are interconnected and have a direct impact on a vital supply chain that includes food and beverage providers, farmers, caterers, transportation and construction, to name just a few. This entire economic network is at risk if the visitor economy is severely damaged. We are already seeing the impacts in our communities. The potential loss of tourism amenities, experiences and infrastructure should concern all British Columbians who value their quality of life and their jobs. Tourism Vancouver, Tourism Richmond and Destination Greater Victoria support the Tourism Industry Association of British Columbia’s $680-million proposal to preserve our vital tourism businesses until next year. A strategic investment as part of the provincial and federal governments’ economic recovery plan will be the difference. Without government help, we’re at risk of seeing large-scale business failures in world-class B.C. tourism destinations. And business failures in our gateways will have a domino effect, negatively impacting businesses in more remote parts of the province."
2,"Air Canada plans to cut its workforce by at least half as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc on the airline industry, according to an internal memo obtained by CBC News. Effective June 7, ""approximately 50 to 60 per cent"" of the company's 38,000 employees will be laid off, the company said in the memo sent to all staff on Friday. ""We estimate about 20,000 people will be affected."" Air Canada said the move comes after a ""fundamental review of what we must do to successfully emerge from this crisis and begin rebuilding our airline."" The airline said it is currently flying at about five per cent of the capacity it flew last year and hopes to ramp up to 25 per cent later in the year if government-imposed travel restrictions are eased. ""Sadly, today the hard truth is that by every indicator we have available to us, we believe that we will be materially smaller for at least three years,"" Craig Landry, Air Canada's executive vice-president of operations, said in the memo. He also said the airline was burning $22 million a day. The announcement comes amid ongoing border shutdowns and confinement measures that have tanked travel demand, prompting Air Canada to ground some 225 airplanes. ""We therefore took the extremely difficult decision today to significantly downsize our operation to align with forecasts, which regrettably means reducing our workforce by 50 to 60 per cent,"" the airline said in an statement on Friday evening. ""We estimate about 20,000 people will be affected."" At a minimum, layoffs will reach 19,000 — half of the current payroll — and could go as high as 22,800. A government source who spoke to CBC News on condition of anonymity on Friday said Ottawa hadn't received notice about the layoffs from Air Canada or a request for a waiver. But in an email to CBC News on Saturday, a spokesperson from Air Canada said the company was not required to notify the Ministry of Labour. On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the minister's office confirmed notice is required for permanent termination of employment, not for temporary layoffs. The blow echoes on a bigger scale Air Canada's announcement in March to let go nearly half of its workforce under a cost reduction scheme. The carrier proceeded to rehire some 16,500 laid-off flight attendants, mechanics and customer service agents in April under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy, but has not committed to maintain the program past June 6. Karl Moore, an airline industry analyst and professor at McGill University, told CBC News that the layoffs are ""not a surprise"" as the pandemic cratered demand. ""The number of people flying is down in a way we've never seen before in aviation history,"" he said. ""Canadians are not willing to be on planes in crowded conditions. Hopefully in a year or two, we'll be beyond that."" Airline mulling wage subsidy decision To minimize the number of layoffs, Air Canada will ask flight attendants to slash their schedules, go on leave for up to two years or resign with travel privileges, according to an internal bulletin to members from the Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) sent out Thursday night and obtained by The Canadian Press. The CUPE memo stated that the union is in discussions with Air Canada over continuing the federal wage subsidy. ""We know this news is not what any of us were expecting,"" said the bulletin, signed by the president of CUPE's Air Canada component and two other union officials. ""The reality is that COVID-19 has severely impacted the demand for air travel over the past few months and into the foreseeable future. As such, there is no denying that we are dealing with the largest surplus of cabin personnel in our history."" Reacting to news about the layoffs, CUPE said in a separate statement that it is ""doing everything it can to protect the livelihoods of our 10,000 flight attendant members."" Air Canada did not respond directly to questions about whether it would drop the wage subsidy, which Ottawa recently extended through August. The subsidy program that allowed employees — including 6,800 flight attendants — to be rehired last month covers 75 per cent of a worker's normal hourly wages or up to $847 per week. The vast majority of those workers have stayed at home, however, as operations remain at a virtual standstill. While Air Canada is not contributing to most worker wages, the airline has continued to put money toward pensions and benefits, a continuous cash drain at a company that lost more than $1 billion last quarter. The Montreal-based company has been bleeding cash since mid-March, slashing its flight capacity by over 90 per cent ahead of even fewer expected passengers between April and June. Though traffic is expected to pick up somewhat before year's end, the approximately 225 grounded planes remain that way, and Air Canada CEO Calin Rovinescu said last week the recovery will be slow, with at least three years of subpar earnings."
3,"Air Canada will temporarily lay off 16,500 employees starting this week as the airline struggles with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. Effective this Friday, the layoffs of 15,200 unionized workers and 1,300 managers will last through April and May amid drastically reduced flight capacity from the Montreal-based airline. “To furlough such a large proportion of our employees is an extremely painful decision but one we are required to take given our dramatically smaller operations for the next while,” chief executive Calin Rovinescu said in a statement. The carrier has halted most of its international and U.S. routes in response to the global shutdown. States from Sweden to China to the United States have rolled out aid packages for the airline sector over the past month as borders closed and travel demand plummeted amid the spread of the novel coronavirus. Air Canada said its cost reduction scheme aims to save least $500 million. It includes a pledge from both the CEO and chief financial officer Mike Rousseau to forego 100 per cent of their salaries, while the rest of the executive team will give up between 25 per cent and 50 per cent. The company will draw down about $1 billion in lines of credit to provide additional liquidity for a carrier that has a $7.3 billion cash cushion to fall back on — more than the most profitable U.S. carrier, Delta Air Lines. Earlier this month Air Canada’s flight attendant union said 5,149 cabin crew would be temporarily laid off due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The newly announced layoffs do not include the earlier job reductions. The pandemic has cost thousands of jobs in the airline sector. Transat AT Inc. has laid off at least 3,600 flight attendants while WestJet has seen 6,900 departures including early retirements, resignations and both voluntary and involuntary leaves. WestJet said Monday it is cancelling all transatlantic and U.S. routes until May 4, extending its 30-day suspension by two more weeks. Both Air Transat and Porter Airlines have halted all flights."
4,"Vancouver Airport Authority announces layoffs due to COVID-19. It’s the first round of layoffs for YVR. In an emailed statement on Wednesday afternoon, the Vancouver Airport Authority, which runs the airport, revealed it is offering voluntary departure packages to its 500 employee workforce. That’s as the aviation industry continues to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with less passenger traffic for the foreseeable future. Employees were notified on Wednesday that the authority is “undergoing workforce reductions”. Layoffs will follow, but the authority hasn’t given a specific timeline but did suggest an update will be shared in around two weeks. These layoffs are contained to the organization itself and not the broader YVR workforce of 26,000 people."
5,"As the coronavirus has spread around the world, international travel has ground almost to a halt as countries locked-down their borders or significantly restricted any but essential travel. Airlines — including Air Canada and WestJet — have cut thousands of workers in order to survive and have seen their stock prices plummet. In an April-end update to the City of Richmond COVID-19 community task force, the YVR president said passenger volumes had declined more than 90 per cent from historical levels. As some countries gain control of the virus’s spread and start easing restrictions, international travel restrictions may also be lifted. But even if and when restrictions are lifted, a major question is whether travellers will return, says Jacques Roy, a professor of transport management at the HEC Montreal business school. Article content Factors that will affect a return of travellers include people’s willingness to book leisure trips, whether businesses will continue remote meetings in place of face-to-face gatherings and the general safety confidence in air travel, noted Roy. “I would like to tell you, it’s going to be two years and it’s going be back to normal, but it’s very difficult to predict,” said Roy. He said he considers the Vancouver airport well-managed and has confidence they will be able to face the challenges. Roy said YVR’s position as a hub for Asia-North American air traffic may help it. He noted Asia has been a growing market and, because of measures some Asian countries have taken, may be able to recover more quickly. Tae Hoon Oum, a professor emeritus at the University of B.C.’s Sauder School of Business, expects air travel to gradually come back but said, until it’s back to normal, that airlines and airports will likely need government assistance. The U.S. and European countries have already stepped up to do so with substantial loan backing, and Canada will likely have to take increased measures, said Oum, who has expertise in air transportation. Article content YVR’s management has been prudent, and historically air travel has grown over the past 30 years, however, this is an extraordinary time, said Oum. “The airline industry is devastated — 90 per cent of flights have been cancelled. Airport revenue will reduce in proportion,” he said. The YVR airport authority’s 2018 financial report, the latest available, showed that in that year the airport had produced more than $100 million in revenue in excess of expenses. However, almost all of the airport’s revenues comes from its air-travel activity, including from landing and terminal fees, and airport improvement fees that passengers pay."
6,"TransLink has put the brakes on major service cuts and almost 1,500 layoffs that would have taken effect later this month, just as the province’s COVID-19 restrictions are now set to loosen. Metro Vancouver’s transit agency said the move was prompted by progress made in talks with the B.C. government to address TransLink’s pandemic-related revenue shortfall, though the province has not yet put a dollar amount on its aid. “This is another important step forward for restarting British Columbia and Metro Vancouver’s economy,” said TransLink CEO Kevin Desmond. “The transit service provided by TransLink is essential to the lives of hundreds of thousands of people in our region. We will be ready to provide safe, reliable transit service as people return to work.” TransLink had planned to cancel 41 bus routes on May 18 and reduce frequency on those that remained. Service hours would have been reduced by 35 per cent compared to early March. TransLink suspended 18 bus routes last month and six last week, and service cuts have already been made to SkyTrain, SeaBus and West Coast Express. There are no plans to rollback the service cuts already made, but the agency is re-evaluating its service needs, along with what it must do to meet health and safety standards as people return to public transit. Ridership on the transit system has dropped by more than 80 per cent since COVID-19 restrictions went into place in mid March, causing TransLink to lose about $75 million a month, primarily due to reduced fare box and gas tax revenue. TransLink had been working with the province on a plan to get the system back up to near normal by September, but those talks were accelerated this week when the province announced plans to lift pandemic restrictions and reopen many closed businesses and services starting on May 19. Although TransLink does not know how much money the province will provide, the agency says it is now confident that it will be able to provide service for those who need it when restrictions are rolled back. Part of the uncertainty is because it remains unclear whether the federal government will aid transit agencies, which are suffering across the country. Municipal Affairs Minister Selina Robinson, who is responsible for TransLink, said the province will continue, along with TransLink, to call on the federal government for support. Jonathan Coté, who chairs the TransLink Mayors’ Council, said the province’s commitment to help TransLink is a first step to returning it to long-term financial health. Unions were relieved that their members’ jobs would be spared. Unifor, which represents 5,000 workers at Coast Mountain Bus Company — 1,200 of whom were facing job losses, most of them bus drivers — said the layoffs would have been devastating for the commutes of front-line workers. “Transit operators and skilled trades maintenance staff are a linchpin in the urban transportation network,” said Gavin McGarrigle, Unifor’s western regional director. “They’re on the front lines with other COVID heroes doing work that it is critical to the Canadian economy during this precarious time.” MoveUP also represents workers at the bus company and TransLink, and the union had been concerned about the public risks associated with transit cuts. SkyTrain attendants and maintenance staff made up most of the 80 layoffs that were slated for CUPE 7000 members. Local president Tony Rebelo said the pandemic confirmed that transit workers provide a critical service for the public and will play an important role in sustaining and rebuilding the economy."
7,"The union representing Metro Vancouver's bus drivers says it's launching a legal challenge to TransLink's recent mass layoffs. On Monday, the transit authority announced that 1,492 employees have been given notice in the face of losses totalling tens of millions of dollars per month because of the COVID-19 pandemic. That includes about 1,200 transit operators and maintenance staff who work for TransLink subsidiary Coast Mountain Bus Company (CMBC), and who are represented by Unifor. Unifor representatives said Thursday that they plan to use the B.C. Labour Code to fight the layoffs. Balbir Mann, president of Unifor Local 111, which represents transit operators, alleged the company didn't provide proper notice of the layoffs. ""We're not going to let the employer cut corners when it comes to layoffs of this magnitude. They should know better,"" he said in a news release. In a written statement, TransLink representatives said they are aware of the legal challenge. ""It is CMBC's position that it has honoured the collective agreement and met all legal obligations,"" the statement said. Unifor also says it is urging the federal government to provide emergency funding to ensure public transit is available during the pandemic."
8,"TransLink has announced nearly 1,500 layoffs and widespread cuts to most modes of public transportation in Metro Vancouver in an effort to save money, as the transit authority continues to lose tens of millions per month due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A statement on Monday said reduced service on buses, SkyTrain, SeaBus and West Coast Express will begin this week. It said the 1,492 employees losing their jobs worked ""in various positions"" at TransLink and its Coast Mountain Bus Company (CMBC) and B.C. Rapid Transit Company subsidiaries. ""This has been an incredibly tough decision and one we do not take lightly,"" TransLink CEO Kevin Desmond wrote in the statement. The cuts come less than a week after TransLink said it was losing $75 million every month due to the health crisis. It said ridership has dropped by more than 80 per cent since mid-March. The authority had warned cuts were imminent without financial help from government. The statement Monday said TransLink has been working with the province ""to ensure that funding is available to allow TransLink to reverse layoffs and return to near-regular operations in time for back-to-school in September."" Senior executive salaries and board compensation has also been reduced by 10 per cent to cut costs. Service expansions, maintenance and rehabilitation work previously planned for 2020 have been deferred. The number of layoffs represents nearly 18 per cent of TransLink's total staff. Eighteen bus routes will be suspended as of Friday, including six NightBus routes. The statement said most of the affected routes were chosen because they have low ridership and ""other transit as alternatives."" TransLink expects to cut another 47 routes in early May, with reduced frequency on most routes left over. It said service to hospitals and other health facilities is being prioritized. SkyTrain service on Millennium, Expo and Canada lines will be reduced by 15-20 per cent. TransLink said they suspended routes ""that are in low ridership areas,"" and the numbers appear to back up that claim. Analysis by CBC News shows the affected routes had 11.6 million combined boardings in 2018. That sounds like a lot — but there were 296 million bus boardings on the entire system that year. To put it another way, TransLink is suspending 28 per cent of its routes, but that only accounts for four per cent of its ridership, based on 2018 data. However, those cuts disproportionately affect people living in Maple Ridge and Pitt Meadows — seven of its 10 routes will be suspended, leaving only the 701, 743, and 745/746 buses remaining. Meanwhile, 24 of 28 routes centred around Burnaby and New Westminster will continue to operate, along with 20 of 25 in the Tri-Cities. Spokesperson Ben Murphy said Monday most people ""will be able to get to where they want to go, albeit in a far less convenient way."" Unifor, the union representing bus drivers in the region, had warned its members in a letter Sunday that CMBC had approached the union about impending layoffs. CMBC handles bus service in the region on behalf of TransLink. Gavin McGarrigle, the union's western regional director, said a drastic cut in staff would affect the entire region as essential workers like health-care professionals, grocery store staff and janitorial workers still rely on transit. ""We think this is highly irresponsible in the middle of this pandemic,"" he said. McGarrigle said scaling back the number of buses on the road is not an alternative solution as remaining buses would then be more crowded, creating difficulties with physical distancing. He added that tensions on bus routes are already high and argued governments need to find another solution to maintain service levels. ""We don't want to be a guinea pig in an experiment over budgets,"" McGarrigle said. ""Governments right now at all levels are struggling with the cost of dealing with this pandemic, but there are some things you can't afford to gamble."" The 50,000-person Hospital Employees Union also spoke against the cuts. ""These service cuts mean added stress for health care and other essential workers in the region who depend on transit to get to work each day,"" said HEU secretary-business manager Jennifer Whiteside in a statement. ""I'm especially concerned for workers who are forced to commute long distances because of high housing costs and who may be working second jobs to support their families. These service cuts will be a huge source of stress for these workers.”"
9,"With demand way down due to COVID-19, BC Ferries will be sailing through rough seas for the foreseeable future. As of late last week, the coastal ferry service said its traffic is down by 80%, reducing fare revenue substantially. Its ancillary revenues coming from food and beverage outlets and retail have also been slashed, as these amenities on ships and at the terminals have been curtailed to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Deborah Marshall, a spokesperson for BC Ferries, confirmed with Daily Hive that up to 1,400 employees will be affected by temporary layoffs, but she was unable to provide any further details as the ferry corporation is still in the process of personally contacting staff to discuss their options. Understandably, the required BC Ferries workforce size has been greatly diminished, given its limited operational levels with far fewer sailings with the routes that use the fleet’s largest vessels. There have been multiple rounds of service level cuts over the last three week, with the steepest reductions to date made this past Saturday. The ferry corporation has made an unprecedented decision to suspend its major West Vancouver Horseshoe Bay to Nanaimo route until further notice. They reasoned that this route carries much less commercial traffic than the other two major routes connecting Metro Vancouver and Vancouver Island. But major cuts have also been made on the two remaining major routes; the Tsawwassen to Swartz Bay route now operates with just four sailings each way per day, while the Tsawwassen to Nanaimo Duke Point route runs with four public sailings and four cargo-only sailings each way per day. This is happening at a time when BC Ferries typically sees a seasonal uptick in traffic, spurred by an increase in recreational and tourism travel. Instead, the first round of layoffs affecting several hundred employees occurred over the weekend. In a release, the BC Ferry & Marine Workers’ Union (BCFMWU) called the decision for layoffs a surprise and alleges this action may be a violation of provisions in their collective agreement. The union said the terms of the agreement stipulates all affected employees must receive notice of layoff and an option of severance pay. “A sudden layoff without notice and other provisions of severance laid out in their collective agreement would be devastating to these workers and their families,” said BCFMWU Provincial President Graeme Johnston in a statement. “We call on BC Ferries to honour the collective agreement while they adjust to service reductions.” They have also threatened possible legal action against the ferry corporation. The pandemic has affected the revenues of all sectors, including the municipal governments of Metro Vancouver, which have collectively laid off several thousand employees over the last two weeks. These employees largely work in shuttered departments, such as public libraries, arts and culture, and parks and recreation. TransLink has also taken a severe beating in its fiscal house; total ridership is down by 83%, and demand for gas at the pump has plummeted to such a low that gas prices in Metro Vancouver were hovering at just 90 cents per litre on Monday. Fare revenue and fuel and parking sales taxes account for over 60% of TransLink’s annual operating budget. However, as of Friday, the public transit authority told Daily Hive they have not had any layoffs. With the depressed ridership levels, TransLink has reduced its frequencies on SkyTrain, SeaBus, West Coast Express, and the conventional buses to cut operating costs. BC Ferries employs about 4,500 people, while TransLink and its operating subsidiaries employ approximately 7,000 people."
10,"No Tourism Bailout without Job Protection for 50,000 Hotel Workers, Says Union Unite Here is pressing government to ensure employees can return to their old jobs as sector recovers. The B.C. government shouldn’t provide bailout funds to the tourism industry without ensuring stronger protections for laid-off employees, says an advocate for hotel workers. “We think at a time when they’re considering a $680-million request for aid to the tourism sector, they have to also consider how they help provide protection for workers laid off due to COVID-19,” said Michelle Travis, research director for Unite Here Local 40, a union representing workers in B.C. hotels, food services and airports. “There seems to be reticence to address the challenge facing 50,000 hotel workers across the province,” she said. “We think they need to act urgently. We’re concerned they may not act on this.” There are many stories about layoffs and terminations in the sector, including at the Holiday Inn and Suites in downtown Vancouver and at the Four Points by Sheraton Vancouver Airport. In that case, the hotel was claiming the pandemic excused it from the responsibility to provide notice or pay severance. Travis recently raised the issue of terminations in the sector in an email to Lisa Beare, B.C.’s minister of tourism, arts and culture. She cited the case of the Pan Pacific hotel in Vancouver where management has asked employees to accept a rollback of their employment rights or risk losing their jobs. “They are being asked to give up their regular status, their schedule and seniority to become casual, on-call workers. It also appears they are being given $250 to sign away any claims on severance,” she wrote. Without action from the province, she said, “more workers will be stripped of their rights and fired. There are too many hotel employers out there who have no interest in doing the right thing and keeping their workforce intact.” Rajini Fjani, who cleaned rooms at the Pan Pacific, said 40 of her former colleagues, some of whom had worked at the hotel for 30 years, got letters asking them to accept becoming casual employees. “Of course it’s unfair,” she said. With five years working at the hotel, Fjani herself was among about 80 people fired. She’s worried about covering expenses, including tuition fees for two daughters in post-secondary school. “They fired us and it was a total shock.” In a July 29 letter responding to Travis, Beare acknowledged that the pandemic continues to heavily impact the sector, but said Labour Minister Harry Bains was the right person to approach since the matter falls under the Employment Standards Act. Finance Minister Carole James gave a similar answer last week. “There’s a variety of agreements in place with operators of hotels and with workers,” she said, noting that in some cases union collective agreements apply and others would be covered by labour laws. “I know those discussions are going on and are not necessarily part of the recovery process, but part of the discussions the labour minister is having with those groups and organizations as well,” James told The Tyee. The government has said it has $1.5 billion to spend on economic recovery from the pandemic, and James said it is still looking through proposals and she couldn’t yet give an indication of the government’s thinking on any specific proposal. Bains and the Labour Ministry have previously said they expect layoffs and terminations to be handled according to the Employment Standards Act and regulations. Travis from Unite Here said the province’s labour laws are insufficient to deal with what workers are facing during the pandemic. “Laid-off workers are being terminated from their jobs before the industry has had a chance to recover,” she said. K.M. Chan was fired in May by the non-union Shangri-La Hotel in Vancouver where he had worked serving in the restaurant for more than five years. Renovations had been started in January and he anticipated being brought back when they were done. Instead he was one of about 60 fired from the staff of around 100 during the pandemic. The team had worked well together and took pride in its high ranking on Trip Advisor and achieving five-star status, Chan said. “I don’t understand why they had to terminate us,” he said. Workers felt “tossed aside” and it was “upsetting and sad,” he said. ““It doesn’t feel right.... They just scattered everyone.” The hotel could have sought a variance under Employment Standards to extend the layoff period and avoided firing people, he said. Chan is receiving the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and will qualify for employment insurance, and is looking for work. “The market isn’t good for hospitality, especially with this many people laid off,” he noted. Travis said unionized workers will soon face similar issues unless the government creates a right-of-recall for all workers that remains in place until the pandemic is over. Workers should have a chance to return to their jobs once the industry recovers, Travis said. If not, employers will hire lower-paid workers as the industry recovers, she said. “That creates basically a race to the bottom.” UPDATE: Labour Minister Harry Bains has appointed labour lawyer Sandra Banister to review workers’ layoff and recall rights in the hotel sector. Banister will work with employers, unions and other relevant organizations, the government said in a release. She will provide a report to Bains by Aug. 20."
11,"In April 2020, COVID began spreading through the Cargill beef slaughterhouse near High River, Alberta. Nearly half of the plant’s 2,000 workers tested positive for COVID – making it, at one point, North America’s largest outbreak linked to a single site. Workers later told media they had been pressured to stay at work, given bonuses if they didn’t miss a shift, cleared to continue working despite showing symptoms, and told they’d be temporarily laid off without pay should they choose to stay home for various reasons. At the time, close to 70 per cent of workers at the plant were of Filipino descent. It was an early warning of how the rest of the pandemic would play out for racialized working-class people. The Filipino community, in particular, has faced compounding challenges: layoffs and lack of work while struggling to send remittances to family in the Philippines; rising anti-Asian racism and violence; fear of accessing health care if undocumented; inequitable vaccine access; and COVID spreading through multi-generational households with essential workers. I spoke to five Filipino activists about the outsized burden Filipino communities in Canada have faced under COVID, and how community members have organized to help each other weather the pandemic. Winnipeg: Diwa Marcelino While I talk on the phone with Diwa Marcelino, our interview is periodically interrupted when Marcelino, a delivery driver, needs to ask people to sign for packages. Marcelino also works with Migrante Manitoba, advocating for worker safety in animal slaughterhouses. He tells me that not everyone knows that “Manitoba is hugely Filipino,” and explains that in the homes of Manitobans, “Tagalog is the second most-spoken language after English.” The government of Manitoba collects statistics on COVID case distribution by ethnicity, and as it notes in its own March 2021 report, “Cases in Filipino people living in Manitoba show the greatest disparity in population size burden of COVID-19. Filipino women are slightly more affected [than] men.” Filipinos – who make up 7 per cent of Manitoba’s population – comprised 12 per cent of the province’s COVID cases. Workers later told media they had been pressured to stay at work, given bonuses if they didn’t miss a shift, cleared to continue working despite showing symptoms, and told they’d be temporarily laid off without pay should they choose to stay home for various reasons. The same report shows that of the Manitobans who got COVID and reported their employment status, 30 per cent worked in the food manufacturing industry. Marcelino says that meat-packers, many of whom are Filipino, are especially at risk: working in close quarters, meat-packing plants employ migrant workers, who often face precarious employment that is out of the media spotlight. Marcelino adds that these workers are least able to weather being laid off or told to quarantine without pay. “A lot of workers in the meat factory who get the sniffles or get a cold, they have to stop work and isolate until they get a negative COVID test. It’s very unfortunate when, by the nature of their work and housing issues and pay and temporary work, they often live in congregate settings because they can’t afford to live in a house – and also because they are paid minimum wage and have nothing,” he says. Marcelino tells me that Manitoba’s vaccine rollout “hasn’t prioritized work in the meat sector. They prioritize age demographics, but not the actual workers who are most affected. Vaccinations are not getting into the arms of these workers. This is month 16 of the pandemic and they still don’t have a shot,” he tells me in April. Later that month, bowing to pressure from unions, the Manitoba government would finally announce that certain front-line workers in hot-spot communities – including those in food processing facilities – would get priority access to vaccines. Toronto: Maria Sol Prieto-Pajadura In the midst of one of Toronto’s seemingly endless semi-lockdowns, TTC busses are full in the early morning. Low-income workers are still commuting to their jobs, even as bus service is limited due to the pandemic. I always seem to run into Sol – as Maria Sol Prieto-Pajadura is often called – on the TTC. She tells me she works two or sometimes three jobs in different locations – as a daycare worker and elder caregiver, depending on the season, and also as a community organizer with Migrante Canada. It seems impossible for one person to do this much, yet she seems calm and unhurried. “If you ride a bus right now, it’s mostly Filipinos going to work, because we work in the service industry: restaurants, coffee shops. We work in the factories,” she explains. “They are breaking their back to work on this essential work to support the economy of Canada, to support the health care of Canada, and yet we are invisible workers. Especially the undocumented, they are not being recognized.” Toronto Public Health confirmed that they do not keep statistics on COVID-19 rates in the Filipino community. They do, however, keep statistics on the Latinx population, who work many of the same jobs as Filipinos in Toronto; the stats show that Latinx people are almost seven times more likely to get COVID-19 than white Torontonians. Christine Mandegarian, a Filipina woman who worked as a personal support worker in a care home in the hard-hit Scarborough region of Toronto, was the second health-care worker in Ontario to die from COVID back in April 2020. While her death was covered extensively in the mainstream press, her ethnicity was rarely mentioned – even though personal support work, like live-in caregiver work, is largely done by women of colour. In a report for the Broadbent Institute, professor Ethel Tungohan wrote that “despite the importance of ‘essential’ labour during this crisis, it is striking to note that mainstream media coverage has mostly ignored the contributions provided by Filipino healthcare workers specifically and all migrant healthcare workers more generally.” “If you ride a bus right now, it’s mostly Filipinos going to work, because we work in the service industry: restaurants, coffee shops. Sol tells me about the work she’s been doing with Migrante Canada to support Filipino workers: “During the pandemic, most of our members are undocumented workers. So during this pandemic, they are the ones who have stopped working because of the lockdown or restrictions. But then they are not eligible for income support.” Without social insurance numbers, undocumented people were unable to apply for the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB). “We keep on contacting our members to see how they are doing. If they get COVID, we assess them, tell them when and how to go to the hospital, and encourage them not to be scared because the hospital doesn’t need a health card for them to access health services right now,” Sol explains. When workers fall sick or lose work, Migrante has stepped in to provide food and funds. “Together with other organizations, we founded Kapit-Bisig. It’s a mutual aid support network,” she explains. Mutual aid has deep roots in Filipino culture, Sol tells me, and the name “Kapit-Bisig” translates to “linking arms” in Tagalog. “We access FoodShare [a Toronto-based food justice project] to give food boxes to our members, and we accessed other NGOs that could access income support from the government and give it to vulnerable sectors of society,” she adds. “During the pandemic, most of our members are undocumented workers. So during this pandemic, they are the ones who have stopped working because of the lockdown or restrictions. But then they are not eligible for income support.” Throughout my interviews, I hear again and again that the lives of Filipino community members in Canada are made more difficult by their precarious immigration status. “Immigration policies in Canada have always been discriminatory to migrant workers,” Sol tells me. “In [the] 1900s, when women came here from Europe to do care work, they got permanent residence. But when Caribbean women started doing caregiving work, they become disposable: they didn’t get permanent status [on arrival]. This continued with Filipinos, both being discriminated against on [the basis of] race and class.” In April, the Canadian government announced it was creating new pathways to permanent residency for 90,000 essential migrant workers and international graduates on a first-come, first-served basis. While it’s a partial win, the Migrant Rights Network has estimated that the program’s restrictions exclude 1.18 million undocumented people, refugees, international students, and migrants in Quebec. Instead of restrictive, piecemeal pilot programs, migrant justice organizers continue to call for all migrants to receive permanent residency upon arrival in Canada. Vancouver & Lower Mainland, B.C.: Alex Alex – who asked that we use only his first name, because of repression against organizers – lives in Vancouver and organizes with a Filipino youth organization called Sulong. He says that migrant worker programs have structured the lives of many in his community, with countless people his age – in their 30s – having parents who came to Canada under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program as live-in caregivers. Today, “a large majority of working Filipinos are some form of migrant labour: Tim Hortons fast-food restaurants, or custodial staff [in] buildings, sometimes delivery truck drivers, or warehouse [workers] – but [the] majority doing some kind of service-based work,” he tells me. Alex says some long-term hotel workers have even been told by their bosses that if they were to return to work they would be forced to take a wage cut and be paid minimum wage. He says that a lot of the Filipino community organizing in B.C. focuses on specific conditions in the Lower Mainland. For example, with astronomically high rents in the Vancouver area, CERB payments were not enough for laid-off workers to pay rent and meet their other basic needs. This became obvious in B.C.’s hotel industry, when thousands of hotel workers were laid off during the pandemic. Hotels have refused to guarantee that workers can return to their jobs once it’s safe to work, and Alex says some long-term hotel workers have even been told by their bosses that if they were to return to work they would be forced to take a wage cut and be paid minimum wage. Women make up over 60 per cent of hotel workers in B.C., and many of them are Filipina. In response, Unite Here Local 40 launched a campaign called “B.C.’s unequal women” to urge customers to boycott the hotels that won’t promise to bring workers back to their jobs. Despite pressure from Filipino groups over the last year, Alex says “the provincial government in B.C. does not keep statistics on specific ethnic/racial demographics on who is being affected [by COVID]. Dr. Bonnie Henry [B.C.’s provincial health officer] just denies the significance of that.” But he adds that it’s common knowledge that the disproportionate number of Filipina women who work as care aides in long-term care homes have been at high risk of contracting COVID. In April 2020, 70 per cent of B.C. senior care workers said they were experiencing a critical shortage of personal protective equipment like masks and hand sanitizer. To make up for low wages in private care homes, care aides often took jobs in multiple facilities, increasing their chance of contracting and transmitting the virus. In May 2020, Henry issued a single-site order for workers at 533 facilities in B.C., but it meant many workers struggled to make ends meet while they waited for the province’s $4/hour pay top-up to come through. Links to the Philippines: Rosie Lucente & Jesson Reyes “We don’t forget that the root cause of migration is because of conditions in the Philippines. That’s why we also fight to address those things,” says Rosie Lucente, the chairperson of the Filipino youth group Anakbayan Toronto. Lucente immigrated to Canada in 2019 and she explains that the struggles faced by working-class Filipinos in Canada “are compounded by what’s happening back home. We have to continuously support our families back home.” She says that it’s for this reason that Anakbayan Toronto advocates for national liberation and genuine democracy in the Philippines, where high rates of extreme poverty, extrajudicial police killings of left-wing activists, and President Rodrigo Duterte’s bloody, five-year-long “war on drugs” have led to a deteriorating human rights situation. “The economy in the Philippines is dependent on remittances from overseas,” says Jesson Reyes, the managing director of the Migrants Resource Centre Canada. According to the World Bank, 9.3 per cent of the country’s GDP came from remittances in 2019. “This is a deliberate economic policy,” Reyes adds, explaining that since the ’70s, the Philippines has prioritized training workers for jobs overseas to quell social unrest due to joblessness and poverty. “Not only is there not enough aid but there’s also a heavily militarized COVID lockdown under Duterte."" He explains that the pressure to support relatives at home has put Filipinos around the world and in Canada in a tough position. For example, Filipinos make up about a third of workers on cruise ships around the world, and COVID restrictions meant that thousands were stranded at sea – sometimes for months – and then repatriated en masse to the Philippines. Reyes says that COVID has increased economic pressure on those who still have jobs abroad to send money back, even though they themselves are struggling. “Not only is there not enough aid but there’s also a heavily militarized COVID lockdown under Duterte,” Lucente adds. “There are military checkpoints in sections of the city. They’ve arrested tens of thousands of people during COVID. Community pantries are shut down as ‘acts of communist terrorism.’ So not only are our communities struggling harder, we are also worried about the political conditions back home.” Lucente says the Filipino-Canadian community’s strength comes from its organization – like the 26 groups from B.C., Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec that have joined the Kapit-Bisig network. “Among Filipino youth […] we have organizations banding together to fight for immediate things like our rights and welfare, wages, social issues but also for a better society in the Philippines at large,” Lucente notes. “We have organization.”"
12,"Prior to the pandemic, Vancouver welcomed millions of visitors from across the globe with a well-deserved reputation for hospitality. A 2017 British Columbia Chamber of Commerce survey ranked tourism as the most significant sector over the next decade. In 2019, BC’s hotel industry generated $3.2 billion and women working in our hotels contributed an estimated $430 million in income taxes in. [1] Women make up the majority of the hospitality workforce in Vancouver and across BC, many of whom are women of color. In March 2020 at the beginning of the COVID pandemic, approximately 50,000 hospitality workers were laid off. The CEO of the BC Hotel Association told the Vancouver Sun, “When business starts increasing, the first thing we’re going to do is rehire our employees…because our greatest asset is our employees.” (September 2020). Instead, hotels across the province permanently terminated long-term staff.  Despite a raft of government subsidies given to employers, they are under no obligation to ensure laid-off workers reclaim their jobs as business recovers. This has only exacerbated precarity for workers, especially for hotel workers in major urban markets like Vancouver, who were hit hard by layoffs. This report takes a closer look at how those terminations have disproportionately affected women, especially women of color. Since the onset of COVID, the hospitality industry has lobbied all levels of government for public relief. The provincial government has provided the sector with close to $230 million in direct relief since December 2020, along with access to $345 million in grants. B.C.’s hospitality sector also received more than $1.2 billion in wage subsidies from the federal government between March 2020 and May 2021. [2] HOW I GOT KICKED OUT FROM THIS LAND IS HOW MY ANCESTORS GOT KICKED OUT I was heartbroken when we were fired. As a member of the Squamish Nation, I thought I deserved to stay on this land and work at the Pan Pacific. How I got kicked out from this land is how my ancestors got kicked out. This is wrong for everyone who lost their job just because of the pandemic. Stephanie Dan, Fired Room Attendant Pan Pacific Hotel, 7 years of Service I JUST WANT MY JOB BACK WHEN THE PANDEMIC IS OVER. I'm devastated that I was fired. I thought I was going to retire at Pan Pacific — but the hotel used the pandemic as an excuse to get rid of many of us. I’m 54 years old so it's hard for me to start again. I worked hard for my job and never came late to work. This isn’t about money. I just want my job back when the pandemic is over. Jerty Gaa, Fired Public Area Attendant Pan Pacific Hotel, 11 years of Service IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC ON WOMEN IN HOSPITALITY Women have been disproportionately affected by job losses since the start of the pandemic. Almost 100,000 women aged 20 and up have exited the labour market entirely, compared with fewer than 10,000 men, according to a report by RBC. [2] Pandemic job losses were overwhelmingly concentrated in the services sector in which women and racialized workers are overrepresented. In travel services, women make up nearly 71% of the workforce, Women employed in accommodation and food and beverage services comprised over 60% of the total employees, according to a report from Destination Canada. Moreover, immigrants comprise 26% of Canada’s tourism workforce, compared with 23.8% of the total labour workforce. [3] Racialized and immigrant workers absorbed greater job losses, perhaps because of their concentration in industries affected by shutdowns. Chinese, South Asian, Filipino, Indigenous and Black Canadians experienced significantly higher rates of unemployment than their white counterparts during the pandemic. [4] In BC, women in accommodation and food services experienced the largest pandemicrelated loss of employment across industries — a decline of 55% in the spring of 2020, [4] While employment levels have risen and fallen as each wave prolongs the pandemic, women continue to experience the unequal impact of job losses in the sector. By September 2021, there were approximately 22,000 fewer women working in hospitality, on average, than in the same period in 2019, a decline of 18%. By comparison, there were more men working in the sector in September 2021, an increase of 7%, than during the same period in 2019. [5] While eased restrictions have prompted some gains in employment, this varies by region. For example, hotels in urban centers that are heavily reliant on international and corporate travel continue to lag behind. Experts don’t predict a meaningful rebound in hotel bookings before 2022. UNITE HERE Local 40 collected data across five BC hotels to determine the impact of the recent wave of terminations on women of colour, Across hotels, the majority of workers fired are women. In 4 of the 5 hotels, women of colour comprise the majority of terminated women. Among the terminated women, the highest rates of women of colour are found in hotels in the Lower Mainland. Among the terminated women, the highest rate of women of colour was found at the Pan Pacific Vancouver Hotel at 94% The largest total number of jobs lost by women was 90 jobs at the Pacific Gateway Hotel. The hotel was taken over by the Trudeau government as a federal quarantine site in March 2020 through present. Approximately 73% of women fired are racialized. WHY ISN'T THE GOVERNMENT HELPING US KEEP OUR JOBS? My hotel laid me off when the federal government took over my hotel and contracted with Red Cross to train others to do my job, which was to clean rooms. I’m 69 years old. I worked all my life for my hotel, and this is how I am treated? I can’t afford to retire right now. Why isn't the government helping us keep our jobs? Gangamma Naidu, Fired Room Attendant Pacific Gateway Hotel, 45 years of Service Much news coverage has been given to the hospitality industry’s concerns over labour shortages. Despite access to government wage subsidies, some employers who terminated workers during the height of the pandemic now find themselves in a labour crunch. This summer, the head of the BC Hotel Association declared the industry needs between 30,000 and 35,000 workers to make up for the shortfall. [7] Meanwhile, workers like Gangamma Naidu, a terminated hotel housekeeper from Richmond’s Pacific Gateway Hotel who spent over 40 years on the job, were forced out of work and have not found comparable pay or hours. In the hotel sector, women have lost ground partly because employers slashed housekeeping, and food and beverage departments where women are concentrated. And fewer women have been recalled back to work. For those who do return, workers may find the jobs more precarious over concerns about health and safety on the job, irregular shifts, and heavier workloads due to short staffing. Yet, many women who lost their jobs after investing years in their hotels want to return to safe, good quality jobs in the hotel industry. Despite mass terminations of workers across BC’s hotel sector, more than 2,500 unionized hotel employees across BC have negotiated extended recall rights through to the end of the pandemic. Women of colour and immigrants who cook, clean and care for hotel guests are among the casualties of the pandemic. The hotel industry treated workers, particularly women of colour, as if they were disposable. Despite government subsidies, grants and other relief, the industry largely failed to commit to bring workers back as business recovers. We call on the hotel industry and government to step up and ensure those most impacted by jobs losses do not permanently lose economic ground. Women of colour, still largely invisible in the hotel industry, absorbed much of the job losses and deserve a pathway forward to more secure, sustainable work. Moving forward, we strongly encourage the B.C. government to reconsider creation of a regulation within Employment Standards to provide recall protections to any worker laid-off as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The province could follow the recent legislative change in U.S. states like California which adopted a law to ensure that no hospitality employer can terminate long-term staff because of the pandemic. On the federal level, the government should condition employers’ pandemic subsidies on worker retention to prioritize laid-off workers having first shot at returning to their jobs."
13,"B.C.’s hotel industry is predicting closures and layoffs in the tens of thousands because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Article content Ingrid Jarrett, president of the B.C. Hotel Association, says there are approximately 60,000 employees working in more than 700 hotels throughout the province, and estimates that two-thirds of those people will be laid off. “So that’s about 40,000 people in the province,” she said. “And I think, truthfully, that is a conservative number.” The 700 figure represents only members of the association, with the total number of hotels in the province closer to 1,000. Jarrett also noted that number of employees only represents the hotel staff and not those working in the adjoining restaurants and pubs, which could also be affected by job losses. Jarrett estimated about 30 hotels have already closed and a further 500 to 600 could be shut by the end of the month. However, she noted that the association will know more when its surveys to members are returned on Monday. Article content “On Tuesday of last week, we all thought, ‘This is a dreadful situation, but we will be okay.’ And then within 72 hours, 80 per cent of the revenue on the books in the province had cancelled,” she said. That means hotels went from about 70 per cent occupancy to under 10 per cent in two days. “It’s been a heartbreaking week. If we can’t recover by summer, then 30 per cent of all those businesses won’t reopen because they can’t stay solvent,” she said. The margins are very tight for the hotel industry, and more than 50 per cent of annual revenue is made during the four months of summer, she added. “The importance of not only flattening the curve with COVID-19, but actually eradicating it as quickly as possible is the only thing that is going to save the industry in 2020,” said Jarrett. Article content One of the hotels that closed temporarily this week and laid off just under 100 employees was the Delta by Marriott in Kamloops. All staff will be offered their jobs back when the hotel reopens. In a bittersweet farewell, the hotel management shared the remaining food from the restaurant fridges with the employees and drank the last of the beer kegs before saying goodbye for an unknown period of time. General manager Bryan Pilbeam said the franchise hotel relies on business travel and tourism, much of which comes from travellers on the Rocky Mountaineer train. “We just need to do all the right things that the (health) authorities have asked us to do,” he said. The hotel was busy through March and had near full bookings through the summer, but in the last week it went from a projected 90 per cent occupancy to single digits, said Pilbeam. Article content “We had 70 pages of cancellations last weekend. The only thing we had booked was someone who couldn’t go to Mexico for their wedding, but now they have cancelled for April too.” Eighty-five per cent of hotels in B.C. are privately owned and operated. Some are planning to house front-line workers and medical teams should the need arise with the outbreak. The association is working with the government to build a contingency fund so operators don’t lose services such as gas, light and heat because they can’t pay their bills. It is also asking municipalities to be flexible on property taxes and advising members to apply for federal funding. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier this week announced $82 billion to help the Canadian economy recover from the financial fallout caused by the pandemic, including $27 billion in support for workers and businesses. Article content Last fall, more than 1,200 hospitality workers were off the job for about a month during strikes at several large downtown Vancouver hotels. Deals were eventually reached over wages and health insurance for workers at the Hyatt Regency, Westin Bayshore, Pinnacle Harbourfront, Four Seasons, and Hotel Georgia, but not before the striking staff lost a month’s wages. Unite Here, a union representing hospitality workers in B.C., says workers are now reeling from the blunt economic trauma caused by COVID-19. “In the span of one week, our members and tens of thousands other hospitality workers in hotels, restaurants and food service workers who prepare meals for airlines, airport travellers, universities and resource camps have lost work, are going on long-term layoffs and are now at risk of losing their medical coverage, which is based on hours worked,” said Zailda Chan, president of Unite Here Local 40. “The loss of income is abrupt and painful. And during a life-threatening global pandemic, the average hospitality worker, many of whom are women with children to support, cannot afford to also lose their medical coverage.” Chan said additional measures will be required to stem the drastic loss of jobs and income faced by workers in hospitality and other sectors of the economy."
14,"VANCOUVER, B.C. — The COVID-19 crisis is deepening for British Columbia businesses with four-in-ten (43%) of those surveyed stating they can only continue to operate for up to three months under current restrictions. For businesses temporarily closed, the future is similarly dire, with only half (53%) expecting to reopen once the restrictions are eased on workplace operations, while 38% are unsure, and 8% will not reopen. This is according to a survey of 1,284 member-businesses of the BC Chamber of Commerce, the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade, the Business Council of British Columbia, and other partners, with the assistance of the Mustel Group. This is the second in a series of pulse checks using the BCMindReader.com platform. Other key findings Revenue declines put wages, rent, and other operational expenses in focus The pandemic caused immediate steep revenue declines but conditions continue to worsen, as respondents monitor their cash flows and operational expenses. Approximately half of all businesses (54% up from 48% in the first survey) state they have experienced revenue decreases of 75% or more while two-thirds (66%) have had revenues drop by 50% or more. The top operating cost or expenses were wages (64%) followed by rent (54%), taxes (34%), and goods and supplies (32%). The majority of businesses (58%) are spending 10% or more of operating expenses on rent, with 42% spending 20% or more. The proportion of wages or rent as a function of overall costs vary depending on firm size, sector, geography, and other factors. Government programs have provided some relief, but many still left out While businesses surveyed are positive about government measures for employees and ensuring supply chains remain open, they are concerned about the speed and scope of programs that support cash flow. Just over half of businesses believe the federal government programs announced to date will be helpful once implemented, but they are not helpful for 33% of businesses, primarily because they do not qualify for any programs or provide enough/timely cash flow relief. Similarly, one-third of businesses (35%) do not find the provincial programs helpful, for the same reasons as federal programs. Businesses with under five employees are least likely (49%) to find federal programs helpful, primarily because they do not qualify. Only one-third of businesses (34%) are confident they will qualify for the 75% wage subsidy program, while 21% are unsure. Reasons for not qualifying include: do not have employees on payroll (46%), revenue has not declined enough (28%), employees laid off (13%), business shut down (11%), seasonal revenue (11%) and start-up or pre-revenue company (10%). Recovery Many businesses are not confident in their ability to restart or whether consumers will return. Key challenges to recovery identified are attracting customers/revenue (79%), having enough operating cash (55%), and rehiring staff (28%). If revenue is the key challenge, half of businesses are unsure what percentage of typical sales or revenues will be required to restart their business, with estimates ranging from less than 30% to more than 70%. ""Government programs are helping businesses but more supports are still needed. Entrepreneurs are saying 'there's a survival runway here' and 'this is exactly what I need to get through this crisis'. How government listens and responds to the business community in the coming weeks will be the game-changer in terms of economic recovery."" Val Litwin, President & CEO, BC Chamber of Commerce ""Businesses are doing everything possible to remain viable, but an increasing number are reaching the point of no return. There is a small window to support the survival and eventual recovery of a significant number of businesses and it is, to a great extent, reliant on the scale and speed of government support, including the recently announced Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program."" Bridgitte Anderson, President & CEO, Greater Vancouver Board of Trade ""Larger businesses remain concerned about their liquidity generally and the speed and scope of support measures for employee wages. While governments and the Bank of Canada have done much in the face of the COVID-19 crisis on these two measures to date, the announced programs have not reached the scale necessary to adequately mitigate the impacts of reduced sales and revenue volumes, operating cost increases or cancelled and deferred capital projects. One of the biggest challenges with these gaps in federal and provincial programs is that larger firms indicate they do not qualify for them."" Greg D'Avignon, President & CEO, Business Council of British Columbia"
15,"OTTAWA — Business groups in Canada are warning that ending federal pandemic-relief programs too soon could send shock waves through the economy. Cutting off wage and rent subsidies as planned on Saturday will force many businesses to reduce their hours, lay off staff or shut down for good, they say. ""It would be absolutely devastating,"" said Bruce Miller, president and CEO at The Works Gourmet Burger Bistro Inc. ""We're just starting to pay back the mountain of debt that we all have. Now is not the time to walk away from us."" The federal government introduced the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy to help businesses cope with pandemic restrictions, rehire workers and resume normal operations. Business groups say cutting off the financial aid amid an unpredictable fourth wave, growing labour shortages and ongoing restrictions such as capacity limits and proof-of-vaccination rules could trigger an economic crash. ""We'll see restaurants close across Canada and fewer people working if the subsidies end,"" Miller said. Restaurants Canada said 80 per cent of restaurants are operating at a loss or barely scraping by. Without subsidies, the industry group said many won't survive the fall and winter. “Most have been losing money or barely breaking even since coming out of initial lockdown last year, and at least 10,000 establishments have already closed,"" Restaurants Canada president and CEO Todd Barclay said in a statement earlier this month. “The rest need government support to help them survive the fall and winter so they can continue feeding our recovery.” Meanwhile, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business said only 40 per cent of businesses are back to normal sales as the deadline for financial aid programs approaches. The group said only businesses with significant ongoing losses are continuing to receive the subsidies. Without the pandemic support, the group warned that there could be another wave of business closures. Corinne Pohlmann, senior vice-president of national affairs and partnerships with CFIB, said the emergency pandemic support has been a lifeline for many businesses. Ending the subsidies at such a critical time in the country's economic recovery would hurt both businesses and workers, she said. ""It would be a huge misstep,"" Pohlmann said. ""Businesses need certainty. So many are still dodging constant curveballs."" The CFIB is also asking Ottawa to scale back the Canada Recovery Benefit, an income support program for workers who do not receive employment insurance benefits. The business group said the program is contributing to the labour shortage by creating a disincentive for some part-time employees to work. Pohlmann said that's because unlike the employment insurance program, which is a percentage of previous earnings, the income benefit for workers is a flat amount. ""For people who normally worked 10 to 15 hours a week, they can actually earn more by remaining on the benefit,"" she said. ""We need to change the program to ensure it doesn't incentivize workers to stay home."" However, a recent report by the Business Development Bank of Canada suggests the phaseout of CERB and programs like it won't fix the issue of labour scarcity. BDB's report said that while sectors like accommodation and food services, retail, and manufacturing have lost thousands of jobs during the pandemic, professional and business services, education, public administration, and health care actually gained workers. In fact, a full 20 per cent of workers who lost their jobs during the pandemic are now working in an entirely different field."
16,"Fraser Health's chief medical officer, Dr. Martin Lavoie, has ordered all indoor gyms and fitness centres to close immediately. This comes three weeks after CTV News first reported about EZ Fit in New Westminster and Burnaby that had decided to keep its 24 hour facilties open.  The order issued by Fraser Health also applies to weight training, gymnastics, martial arts facilities, yoga and dance studios and other facilities. Lavoie has determined that the use of these types of facitilies can promote the transmission of COVID-19. The order is set to expire at the end of May but is subject to revision, cancellation or extension. Lavoie didn't get into specific numbers about how many gyms had remained opened but says his department physically visited a handful of sites and issued the order directly to them. ""For those we had concerns with yes, we did,"" Dr. Lavoie said. He said the order extends to all facilities both private and municipally owned, like recreation centres and shared facilties in condominium complexes. ""Anywhere where you can actually have congregation of people playing sports, that's the concept,"" he added. ""I would be surprised that people defied such an order but if that happens, we would certainly act on that,"" Dr. Lavoie said. Any gyms that defy the order could potentially be fined. When asked why it took weeks to shut them down after other gyms had voluntarily closed, Dr. Lavoie said it took time to realize the risks and to determine that these facilities could not adhere to the proper cleaning techniques and distancing requirements that have been set down by the provincial health officer. April 3, 2020 On April 3 Island Health also ordered gyms and fitness centres to close. That order expires at the end of May and could also be extended. Updated: April 2, 2020 The Chief Medical Health Officer at Interior Health has issued an order for all fitness centres, gyms, yoga studios or similar personal training facilities to close as of April 2, 2020. The health officer has determined these types of facilities promote the transmission and spread of COVID-19. The order expires on May 30, 2020. Even with this move, there has so far been no order to close gyms in Metro Vancouver - despite complaints. March 26, 2020 Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry has asked us all to limit our time in public and has ordered many kinds of businesses to close, including bars, clubs, salons, spas and tattoo parlours. However she has not issued a province wide order to close gyms. ""Each region is dealing with these issues on a complaints basis. Public health officials are responding on an individual basis. There were a number of cases in Interior Health that led them to issue the order,"" she stated. Many fitness centres closed voluntarily a couple of weeks ago and now CTV News is getting complaints about those that remain open. EZ Fit in New Westminster is still open 24 hours a day and some of its members are concerned. “Well you’re sharing equipment even if you do go ahead and wipe that down it’s just, there’s too much of a risk,” said Johanton, an EZ Fit member who did not want his last name used. CTV News visited both the Burnaby and New West locations and saw signs on the door limiting the number of people allowed inside; just 11 at the New Westminster location, 16 at the Burnaby gym. There are also signs on the door advising health precautions to take and encouraging physical distancing. One member working out inside was asked if he was worried about the Corona virus. “No, I hear about corona but there’s not that much people though,” he said, looking around at a few other members working out. Dr. Henry has asked all of us to do our part. “We need to connect virtually. We need to have a safe space between us for the next little while,” she said. “Small groups, even two or three, can sometimes be that transmission point.” Yet gyms can stay open as long as they meet the health requirements set down by health officials including, cleaning recommendations and physical distancing. But with many gyms deciding to shut down voluntarily, we asked EZ Fit owner Shing Tam why he hasn’t. “Right now the B.C. government says anything above 50 people has to close. They never said that fitness centres or gyms has to close,” he said. Tam says first responders have been asking for a place to work out and he wants to give it to them. “We have sanitizer, we have soap, we are mopping every day,” he said. He says if the province tells him to close he’ll do that but will remain open until then. However, he’s getting some push back from people who have been weighing in. “I don’t know who makes the decisions but I don’t think they’re doing the right thing,” said Johnathon. “So I think they’ve gotten some comments. They’re going to have to make a decision pretty quick here.”"
17,"VANCOUVER -- With a recent surge in B.C.’s COVID-19 numbers linked to young people going to bars and nightclubs, the co-owner of the PumpJack Pub on Davie Street says he’s doing everything he can to keep his patrons physically distanced. Customers must stay at their assigned tables in groups no larger than six with absolutely no mingling allowed. ""Sometimes people come in their groups of 10. They’re separated, and they want to go and party. We tell them that’s not the way,"" said Vince Marino. ""Our staff is constantly reminding them, and every time we turn around and somebody is (not obeying), we ask them to please follow the rules."" But he admits there are always a few who push the limits, and after several warnings, staffers have to ask them to leave. "" ""Maybe we have to send a little stronger message that they’ve got to be part of the solution,"" he said. ""It’s really not the operators from my experience, it's customers who are violating those protocols,"" said Jeff Guignard with the B.C. Alliance of Beverage Licensees. ""The challenge comes from late in the evening, people have had a couple of drinks, they start to congregate. Operators are going out again and again and again, stopping people from doing that. But if we’re gonna succeed in this environment, we’re going to need customers, especially young customers, to get on side."" WorkSafeBC has conducted more than 1,200 inspections of restaurants, bars and nightclubs, which are only allowed to operate as lounges. ""Most of those employers have COVID safety plans in place,” said WorkSafeBC’s Al Johnson. ""I think what’s happening right now, is we need those employers to stay vigilant."" WorkSafe will be stepping up random inspections at nightclubs and bars in the coming weeks. ""We will also be doing after-hours inspections,"" said Johnson. ""We go into those workplace typically not during the regular working day, but maybe later in the evening."" Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry is also expected to announce new enhanced COVID-19 protocols for bars and clubs later this week. ""From what I’ve seen and been dialoguing, I didn’t see anything that was way out of this world that we cannot work with, and retool if we have to retool,"" said Marino. ""We are totally supportive of the public health officer's comments on where she wants to go, and now the clientele needs to be a little more part of the solution."" Guignard agrees. ""If we’re going to succeed in this environment, we’re going to need customers, especially young customers, to get on side,"" he said."
18,"Jan 6 (Reuters) - Cineplex Inc (CGX.TO) is temporarily laying off 6,000 part-time employees due to mandated closures of its venues amid surging COVID-19 cases caused by the Omicron variant, the Canadian cinema operator said on Thursday. Globally, coronavirus cases have been rising rapidly due to the highly transmissible variant. In Canada, 36,110 new infections were reported on an average each day, according to a Reuters tally. (https://tmsnrt.rs/3n1lii2) Due to mandated closures of Cineplex's theatres and entertainment sites across Ontario and Quebec, the company had yet again decided to temporarily lay off its part-time workforce, Cineplex spokeswoman Sarah Van Lange said. Cineplex had taken similar actions for all provincial government mandated closures earlier since the pandemic began, she added. Out of the 6,000 workers being laid off, 5,000 are in Ontario. The cinema industry has been one of the worst affected sectors by the pandemic, with lockdowns shutting cinemas and delaying movie releases at a time when the industry has been trying to stave off increased competition from streaming services. In December, the 2019 planned acquisition of Cineplex by British cinema operator Cineworld (CINE.L) was scrapped."
19,"Cineplex has temporarily laid off nearly 5,000 part-time employees as its movie theatre and entertainment venues in Ontario were ordered by the province to shut down amid the rise of the COVID-19 Omicron variant. ""We are eager to get our team back to work once and for all, as soon as these temporary restrictions are lifted,"" a company spokesperson told CTVNews.ca on Wednesday. Ontario put in place new public health measures starting Jan. 5, including restrictions on gatherings, building capacity limits and the closure of schools and other spaces. This isn’t the first time Canada’s largest movie theatre chain has issued pink slips during the COVID-19 pandemic. Cineplex also temporarily laid off thousands of part-time workers in March of 2020 after closing cinemas and entertainment venues."
20,"With plummeting revenues and soaring unexpected emergency response expenses, municipal government employees have not been immune to the challenging economic conditions onset by COVID-19. Municipalities across the region have been temporarily laying off some employees, with significant jobs already shed from the City of Vancouver just three weeks into the escalating epidemic. In a statement to Daily Hive, Deputy City Manager Paul Mochrie says there have been about 1,500 layoffs to date, specifically workers who operate community centres, civic theatres, and Vancouver Public Library. These city departments and services are of course temporarily shuttered as a precaution to protect workers and the public from the coronavirus. “This is a temporary situation exclusively due to the COVID pandemic,” he reiterated. “When we begin to reopen City services and recall workers, the agreement has employees coming back to their original positions.” In the meantime, he says, the city is providing pay protection and a continuation of benefits to affected staff, with pay continuity of up to 42 days and extended health benefits for three months. The city is doing its best with redeploying employees in closed facilities and departments to other areas in need, including the new demands as a result of the pandemic. A Staff Redeployment Office has been created to centralize and facilitate these redeployment opportunities. The City of Vancouver employs approximately 7,000 people. According to a January 2020 fiscal report created by city staff, the city’s operating budget in 2019 $1.47 billion, with $915 million going towards wages, salaries, and benefits. Employees in Community and Cultural Services were paid $39.5 million, and Parks and Recreation saw a compensation of budget of $118.6 million. Those working for the Vancouver Public Library were paid $41.7 million. Last year, the city collected $873.5 million in property taxes, penalties, and interest — up from $833 million in 2018. It also saw revenues of $299.4 million from utility fees, $127 million from program fees, $96 million from licence and development fees, $103 million from parking revenues, $78 million from civic facility revenues, $22.2 million from bylaw fines, and $132.7 million from developer contributions. But most of these fee-based revenue sources are now on the verge of collapse, with civic facilities closed, parking and bylaw enforcement largely suspended, and much of the business activities halted. Moreover, possible measures that provide residents and businesses with interim financial relief, especially through broad-reaching deferrals in property taxes and utility fees, could add more red ink. Remarkably, this is only beginning; the longevity of the crisis and societal shutdown, as a result of government-mandated physical distancing and self-isolation, is expected to last for months, but its impact could be far longer if the pandemic returns in waves later this year and in 2021, until a vaccine is ready. The municipal government has a General Revenue Stabilization Reserve of $146.3 million for use as an operating contingency in case of inclement weather, catastrophic events, environmental hazards, extraordinary public safety situations, and economic downturns. At the end of 2019, its specific purpose reserves totalled $1.285 million, an increase of $107.1 million over 2018."
